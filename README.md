# javascript-slider

This assignment is to build a re-usable horizontal slider control in HTML/Javascript/CSS.  You can use any javascript tools you like as long as you don't use a pre-built slider control.  The purpose of this excercise is to demonstrate that you can solve problems by building new components when necessary.  

Here are the requirements:

1. Make a fork of this repository and implement your changes there.
2. The control must have call backs (or promises) that will run when the slider is repositioned.
3. The control must have a method of obtaining the current value of the slider.
4. When positioning, the control must support snapping to the next integer.  A 200 pixel wide slider configured for values ranging from 0-9 would snap in increments of 20 pixels.
5. Create a document targeted to other programmers describing how to configure and use the slider.
6. Create an HTML example page demonstrating how to use the slider.
7. Commit all these changes to your repository and create a pull request back to the original BambooHR/javascript-slider project.
8. We will review the pull request looking closely at the implementation quality, documentation, and configurability.
